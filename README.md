# Digital-Logic-Design
My lab materials for DLD (Diode Logic with Feedback) circuits are stored in this repository. These are digital logic circuits that implement logic operations using resistors and diodes. Circuit schematics, truth tables, and simulation results are all included in the files.

Each lab file is associated with a particular DLD circuit and contains information about the function and design of that circuit. Individual and group assignments are included in the files, which are arranged by lab session.

These lab files offer a thorough introduction to DLD circuits and show how they can be used in digital systems. Students and amateurs interested in digital electronics and circuit design can use them.
